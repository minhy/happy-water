The probation team working on the case &#39;needed more time&#39;, one of Kurniawan&#39;s defence lawyers, Jerry Mooney, told Decanter.com.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside wine fraud, Kurniawan was also convicted of fraudulently attempting to get a $3m loan. He faces up to 40 years in prison, although several observers believe he may get significantly less than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kurniawan is the first person to have faced criminal prosecution for wine fraud in the US. It took a 12-strong jury less than a single morning to convict him after several days of mounting evidence: from the foil cover on his kitchen window to the requests for empty bottles from restaurants and the presentation in court of counterfeit wines and labels that were found in the defendant&#39;s home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prosecutors described how Kurniawan turned his home computer into a virtual &#39;ATM machine&#39; that printed out fake labels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Winemaker Laurent Ponsot told jurors that a purported Domaine Ponsot Clos Saint-Denis 1945 &#39;cannot exist&#39;, because the estate only began producing under this appellation in 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kurniawan&#39;s defence team maintained throughout that their client was naively embroiled in a much bigger fine wine counterfeiting scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Billionaire wine collector Bill Koch, who also gave evidence at the trial after buying wines traced back to Kurniawan, still has a lawsuit pending against the Indonesian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Koch is also trying to get Acker Merrall &amp; Condit&#39;s CEO, John Kapon, in court to explain how Acker Merrall came to sell counterfeit wines consigned by Kurniawan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, allegations surrounding the authenticity of rare wine continue to cause problems for the industry. This week, it emerged that Atlanta-based wine collector Julian LeCraw has filed a lawsuit seeking $25m in damages from London-based Antique Wine Co, who he accuses of selling him several fake wines, including a supposed 1787 vintage Chateau d&#39;Yquem.

And as we become more active, so do we.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More vigorous activity in this weather generally means we sweat more. How can you replace the body fluids you&#39;re losing? And do you really need to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s answer the second question first. &quot;Yes!&quot; nutrition experts say emphatically. &quot;Most people are walking around in a moderately dehydrated state,&quot; says Susan Kleiner, PhD, RD, author of Power Eating. According to Kleiner, we all need a &quot;bare minimum&quot; of 8 to 12 cups of fluids daily, even more to replace the fluid you lose during exercise. Of these 8 to 12 cups, Kleiner advises at least 5 cups be pure water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sweating It Away</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kleiner explains that you lose about 4 cups of water per hour of exercise, depending on how much you weigh and how much -- and how quickly -- you perspire. A moderate workout in a mild climate will likely result in a loss of 1 to 2 quarts of fluid per hour through perspiration. The more intense the exercise or the more extreme the temperatures, the greater the fluid loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you don&#39;t replenish your fluid losses during exercise, you will fatigue early, and your performance will be diminished,&quot; says Kleiner. &quot;If you don&#39;t replenish fluid after exercise, your performance on successive days will decay, and your long-term health may be at risk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAccording to the National Athletic Trainers&#39; Association, says Kleiner, dehydration can impair your physical performance after less than an hour of exercise -- even sooner if you start working out in a dehydrated state. It can also increase your risk of developing symptoms of heat illness, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not Just for Athletes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s not just athletes -- even the weekend variety -- who are dehydrated, says Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, author of From Fatigued to Fantastic!: A Manual for Moving Beyond Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia. For even the sedentary he suggests: &quot;Simply occasionally pay attention to your mouth and lips. If they are dry, you&#39;re thirsty and need more water.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dehydration can be a serious problem for anyone, but children and older adults are at greater risk, according to the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. It offers these tips to avoid dehydration:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When exercising, drink early and often. Research shows exercise under warm or hot and humid conditions can cause dehydration in as little as 30 minutes. So it&#39;s important to consume fluids not only during and after exercise, but also before a workout or strenuous activity.<br />\r\nDon&#39;t wait until you&#39;re dehydrated to start drinking. Drinking in a dehydrated state can cause gastrointestinal distress.<br />\r\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends that athletes drink enough fluid to fully replace sweat losses during their activity. At a minimum, drink 8 to 10 ounces of fluid every 15 minutes during exercise.<br />\r\nWhen active, don&#39;t rely on your sense of thirst. When you are hot and sweaty, your thirst mechanism can shut off quickly and you may not realize you need fluids. Drink on a schedule.<br />\r\nCheck the color of your urine. If your urine looks like the color of apple juice, you are probably dehydrated. If it looks more like the color of lemonade, you are probably well hydrated.</p>\r\n','images/upload/abc.jpg',1,'2014-04-16 00:00:00','2014-04-24 00:00:00','','Yes, water is everywhere these days, but are you drinking enough of it?','news'),(8,'6 Reasons to Drink Water','<p>Americans seem to carry bottled water everywhere they go these days. In fact, it has become the second most popular drink (behind soft drinks). But water lovers got a jolt recently when we heard that a new report had found that the benefits of drinking water may have been oversold. Apparently, the old suggestion to drink eight glasses a day was nothing more than a guideline, not based on scientific evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But don&#39;t put your water bottle or glass down just yet. While we may not need eight glasses, there are plenty of reasons to drink water. In fact, drinking water (either plain or in the form of other fluids or foods) is essential to your health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Think of water as a nutrient your body needs that is present in liquids, plain water, and foods. All of these are essential daily to replace the large amounts of water lost each day,&quot; says Joan Koelemay, RD, dietitian for the Beverage Institute, an industry group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Permanente nephrologist Steven Guest, MD, agrees: &quot;Fluid losses occur continuously, from skin evaporation, breathing, urine, and stool, and these losses must be replaced daily for good health,&quot; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When your water intake does not equal your output, you can become dehydrated. Fluid losses are accentuated in warmer climates, during strenuous exercise, in high altitudes, and in older adults, whose sense of thirst may not be as sharp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHere are six reasons to make sure you&#39;re drinking enough water or other fluids every day:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Drinking Water Helps Maintain the Balance of Body Fluids. Your body is composed of about 60% water. The functions of these bodily fluids include digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and maintenance of body temperature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Through the posterior pituitary gland, your brain communicates with your kidneys and tells it how much water to excrete as urine or hold onto for reserves,&quot; says Guest, who is also an adjunct professor of medicine at Stanford University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&#39;re low on fluids, the brain triggers the body&#39;s thirst mechanism. And unless you are taking medications that make you thirsty, Guest says, you should listen to those cues and get yourself a drink of water, juice, milk, coffee -- anything but alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Alcohol interferes with the brain and kidney communication and causes excess excretion of fluids which can then lead to dehydration,&quot; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Water Can Help Control Calories. For years, dieters have been drinking lots of water as a weight loss strategy. While water doesn&#39;t have any magical effect on weight loss, substituting it for higher calorie beverages can certainly help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What works with weight loss is if you choose water or a non-caloric beverage over a caloric beverage and/or eat a diet higher in water-rich foods that are healthier, more filling, and help you trim calorie intake,&quot; says Penn State researcher Barbara Rolls, PhD, author of The Volumetrics Weight Control Plan.</p>\r\n','images/upload/shutterstock_64070419.jpg',1,'2014-04-16 00:00:00','2014-04-24 00:00:00','','Americans seem to carry bottled water everywhere they go these days.

The suit claims the delay is unjustified and is asking the court to impose a faster deadline.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Made famous by the 2000 film &#39;Erin Brockovich,&#39; hexavalent chromium is a known carcinogen and drinking water contaminant,&quot; the complaint says. &quot;At least one-third of drinking water sources sampled statewide - sources that provide drinking water to tens of millions of Californians - are contaminated with hexavalent chromium concentrations higher than those that the state deems to pose no significant health risk.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nContinuing, the suit says, &quot;More than a decade after the Legislature ordered the Department to act, and more than eight years after the statutory deadline for action passed, the Department has not even proposed a hexavalent chromium drinking water standard. The Department presently estimates on its website that it will not publish a final drinking water standard for hexavalent chromium for at least another two to three years.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Forced to act by the real-life Brockovich</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe agency&#39;s failure to develop standards is creating a public health nuisance and endangering residents and visitors, say the groups.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHexavalent&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/chromium.html\">chromium</a>&nbsp;is a heavy metal that is also known as chromium-6.

It can also occur naturally, however.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe state Legislature directed the health department to act after the real-life Brockovich exposed the case of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corp., which stood accused of leaking the chemical into the groundwater of Hinckley, a small town in the Mojave Desert about 122 miles northwest of Los Angeles, which caused health problems, including cancer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn its website, the department said in a July 27, 2011 announcement it established a Public Health Goal (PHG) of 0.02 parts per billion (ppb) for hexavalent chromium, the so-called &quot;Erin Brockovic Chemical.&quot; &quot;The health-protective level is based on avoidance of potential carcinogenic effects,&quot; the announcement said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNevertheless, say plaintiffs, a third of all&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/drinking_water.html\">drinking water</a>&nbsp;sources tested in the state have hexavalent chromium concentrations of at least one part per billion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Plaintiffs to court: Set a date for compliance</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;A hexavalent chromium concentration of one part per billion is fifty times the public health goal.

The groups called the delay in fixing standards &quot;unreasonable and unjustified,&quot; as well as a violation of the state&#39;s Health &amp; Safety Code.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe groups have asked the court to compel the department to set drinking&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/water.html\">water</a>&nbsp;standards &quot;on a date set by the court that will ensure speedy performance of the statutory duty.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe&nbsp;<em>Environmental Protection Agency</em>, by the way, has not set federal contamination levels for chromium-6, though the agency last year released recommendations for monitoring the chemical in water tables and is further considering whether to set nationwide chromium-6 standards.</p>\r\n','images/upload/drinkingwater.jpg',NULL,'2014-10-10 00:00:00','2014-04-28 00:00:00','','(NaturalNews) A third of all drinking water sampled in California is contaminated with hexavalent chromium, a carcinogen, say environmental groups in a lawsuit targeting the state\'s Department of Public Health.','news'),(10,'Drinking water with meals can impair digestion','<p>It&#39;s true that the entire digestive system works more efficiently when it&#39;s well-hydrated, but this doesn&#39;t mean it should be flooded with cold water right when it&#39;s working to digest your last meal. Too much water during meals can interfere with natural levels of acid and bile needed in the stomach to properly digest your food. In particular, too much&nbsp;<em>cold</em>&nbsp;water during meals can slow digestion and may cause cramping in sensitive individuals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Tips for Drinking Water with Meals</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe general rule of thumb is to avoid drinking water from about 15 minutes before you eat until at least one hour after you eat. But it&#39;s all too common for people to go to extremes with this advice. Avoiding any and all liquids before, during and after meals is rarely needed to see improvements in digestion. Instead, apply these simple tips for drinking at mealtime:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>1. Think small sips.</strong>&nbsp;You don&#39;t have to forego water during meals altogether. Instead, simply opt to take small sips of water during your meal. This is great for cleansing the palate and maintaining hydration without flooding your digestive system with massive amounts of water just when it&#39;s getting down to business. You can also add a squeeze of lemon or a bit of apple cider vinegar to your&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/water.html\">water</a>&nbsp;to help aid the digestive process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>2. Choose warm over cold.</strong>&nbsp;Iced drinks may be particularly problematic during meals, especially for those with existing digestive issues. If you&#39;d like to have something to sip on during meals, warm liquids are more friendly for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/digestion.html\">digestion</a>. Warm tea or homemade broth are excellent to accompany your meal, and can actually aid digestion rather than impair it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>3. Hydrate before you eat.</strong>&nbsp;If you frequently find yourself thirsty during and after your&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/meals.html\">meals</a>, it may help to make a habit of drinking a glass or two of pure water about 15 to 30 minutes before you eat. This can prevent the urge to drink too much water while your stomach is working to digest your meal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>4. Stay hydrated during the rest of the day.</strong>&nbsp;Drinking during meals can be a difficult habit to break. However, it&#39;s easier to do if you keep yourself hydrated the rest of the time. Begin your day by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/drinking.html\">drinking</a>&nbsp;a glass or two of pure water and then make a habit of repeating this between meals. Soon you&#39;ll be well-hydrated and won&#39;t crave large amounts of water during your meals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>5. Think moderation.</strong>&nbsp;There is no reason to become dogmatic about drinking during meals. Some people find it makes an enormous difference to avoid drinking a lot of liquid during a meal, while others find it has little effect. Others note that simply avoiding ice water or not drinking quite so much water during meals is enough to ease their digestive woes. It will depend on the individual how much of an impact this has on his/her digestion, but it&#39;s worth considering if you have problems with gas, bloating or pain after meals.</p>\r\n','images/upload/persondrinkingwater-2.jpg',1,'2014-04-21 00:00:00','2014-04-28 00:00:00','','(NaturalNews) Most of us have heard it a hundred times: drink eight glasses of water a day to stay healthy and hydrated.

Vitaminwater&#39;s &quot;Power-C&quot; flavor, for instance, claims to deliver &quot;zinc and vitamin C to power your immune system,&quot; while the &quot;XXX&quot; flavor is branded as containing &quot;antioxidant vitamins to help fight free radicals and help support your body.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth claims are an immense exaggeration, as these two vitaminwater products are composed primarily of water, sugar, and a handful of synthetic vitamins, which is hardly a recipe for robust immunity. And yet this is the overall image being portrayed by Coca-Cola for its vitaminwater line of beverages, which is really nothing more than glorified soda pop without carbonation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The marketing of vitaminwater will go down in history as one of the boldest and brashest attempts ever to affix a healthy halo to what is essentially a junk food, a non-carbonated soda,&quot; says Michael F. Jacobson, Executive Director of CSPI. &quot;Vitaminwater, like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/Coca-Cola.html\">Coca-Cola</a>&nbsp;itself, promotes weight gain, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cannot deliver on any of the dishonest claims it has made over the years.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe class action originally sought monetary damages for vitaminwater&#39;s misleading branding, but U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Levy in Brooklyn, New York, recently decided that this would not be allowed as part of the case. Since individual damages are likely small, and because there are obvious variations in how much money each individual would be entitled to receive, Judge Levy decided that the plaintiffs simply do not have an adequate damages model that can be used to effectively distribute damages.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Coca-Cola to face jury trial for tricking consumers into thinking vitaminwater can heal disease</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, Judge Levy did announce that the suit itself appears valid, and recommended that Coca-Cola face the accusations in court. The case will now move on to U.S. District Judge Dora Irizarry for approval, and is expected to eventually go to trial based on Judge Levy&#39;s recommendations. If everything goes as intended, Coca-Cola will soon have to defend its<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/vitaminwater.html\">vitaminwater</a>&nbsp;claims in court before a jury, which CSPI believes will be a major tipping point for Coca-Cola&#39;s branding of vitaminwater.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;(Thursday&#39;s decision) puts this case on a glide path toward a jury trial where Coca-Cola will have to defend under penalty of perjury the deceptive&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/claims.html\">claims</a>&nbsp;it has made and continues to make in connection with vitaminwater,&quot; said CSPI Litigation Director Steve Gardner in a recent statement. &quot;That will put the company in the awkward position of squaring its marketing of vitaminwater as a healthy, disease-fighting drink with its later assertion that &#39;no reasonable consumer&#39; would ever believe such marketing.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCoca-Cola is not alone in being sued for deceiving the public about the health benefits of its products.

These include hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates. As discussed in previous articles, hydroxide ions are always present in water, even if the concentration is extremely low. However, significant concentrations of hydroxides are unusual in natural water supplies, but may be present after certain types of treatment. Small amounts of carbonates are found in natural water supplies in certain sections of the country, rarely exceeding 3 or 4 gpg. They may also be found in the water after lime soda has been used to soften the water. Bicarbonates are the most common sources of alkalinity. Almost all natural supplies have a measurable amount of this ion, ranging from 0 to about 50 gpg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ph-kit<br />\r\nAlkalinity. The alkalinity of water may be defined as its capacity to neutralize acid. Alkali substances in water include hydroxides or bases. They can be detected by their acrid taste and by the fact that they cause red litmus paper to turn blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phosphates and silicates are rarely found in natural supplies in concentrations significant in the home. Compounds containing these ions may be used in a variety of water treatment processes. Moderate concentrations of alkalinity are desirable in most water supplies to balance the corrosive effects of acidity. However, excessive quantities cause a number of problems. These ions are, of course, free in the water, but have their counterpart in cations such as calcium, magnesium and sodium or potassium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You probably will not notice an alkaline condition due to bicarbonate ions except when present in large amounts. In contrast, you should readily detect alkalinity due even to fairly small amounts of carbonate and hydroxide ions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strong alkaline water has an objectionable &quot;soda&quot; taste. The EPA Secondary Drinking Water Regulations limit alkalinity only in terms of total dissolved solids (500 ppm) and to some extent by the limitation on pH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highly mineralized alkaline waters also cause excessive drying of the skin due to the fact that they tend to remove normal skin oils.<br />\r\nTroublesome amounts of alkalinity can be removed by reverse osmosis, along with other total dissolved solids. Other methods of water treatment also remove total dissolved solids, but they are somewhat less suitable for household use compared to reverse osmosis. These methods are distillation and deionization (demineralization).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several other methods of water treatment will remove alkalinity, but these methods are not satisfactory for household use. They include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Lime softening removes hardness. At the same time, this process will precipitate an equivalent amount of alkalinity. Lime softening is usually restricted to industrial and municipal installations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lime softening. While reducing total alkalinity, lime softening does convert HC03&ndash; to CO3--, a stronger alkalinity ion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. An anion resin regenerated with sodium chloride removes substantially all the anions (carbonates, bicarbonates, and sulfates, as well as nitrates). It replaces these anions with a chemically equivalent amount of chloride ions. The disadvantage of this process is that in almost all cases, it results in a high chloride ion concentration. At the point of exhaustion, the resin has the tendency to unload high concentrations of the anions it carries including the nitrates. For household purposes, such results are almost as undesirable as the original alkalinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The feed of a mineral acid will neutralize the alkalinity of a water. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or a combination of these can be used. This process converts the bicarbonates and carbonates present into carbonic acid. At this point, it is advisable to provide some method to permit the resulting carbon dioxide gas to escape into the atmosphere. The disadvantages of this acid feed technique are obvious. It is important to have precise control of the process and caution in handling the strong acid.</p>\r\n','images/upload/ph-kit.jpg',1,'2014-04-29 00:00:00','2014-04-29 00:00:00','','Alkalinity of water may be due to the presence of one or more of a number of ions.

This substance also known as water, is one of the most essential elements to health and is so important that your body actually has a specific drought management system in place to prevent dehydration and ensure your survival. Water might be everywhere, but one must never take it for granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water makes up more than two thirds of human body weight, and without water, we would die in a few days. The human brain is made up of 95% water, blood is 82% and lungs 90%. A mere 2% drop in our body&#39;s water supply can trigger signs of dehydration: fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on smaller print, such as a computer screen. (Are you having trouble reading this? Drink up!) Mild dehydration is also one of the most common causes of daytime fatigue. An estimated seventy-five percent of Americans have mild, chronic dehydration. Pretty scary statistic for a developed country where water is readily available through the tap or bottle water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dad and sonWater is important to the mechanics of the human body. The body cannot work without it, just as a car cannot run without gas and oil. In fact, all the cell and organ functions that make up our entire anatomy and physiology depend on water for their functioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water serves as a lubricant<br />\r\nWater serves as a lubricant in digestion and almost all other body processes. The water in our saliva helps facilitate chewing and swallowing, ensuring that food will slide easily down the esophagus. Water also lubricates our joints and cartilages and allows them to (pardon the pun) move more fluidly. When dehydrated, the body rations water away from the joints. Less lubrication equals greater friction and that can cause joint, knee and back pain potentially leading to injuries and arthritis. Even our eyeballs need plenty of lubrication to work well and remain healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWater regulates body temperature<br />\r\nOur bodies can control over-heating through perspiration from sweat glands in the skin and from evaporation which produces a cooling effect. Blood is also routed into areas close to the surface of the skin where it can be cooled and then carried back to the interior of the body. Conversing in a cold environment, the skin maintains proper body temperature by shunting the blood away from the exterior surface thereby conserving heat within the body. The movement of water within our cellular systems also transports vital blood plasma which is 92% made of water. Blood plasma play a critical role in buffering the body&rsquo;s pH, circulating antibodies from the immune system, and regulating osmotic balance which all helps to maintain proper body temperature.</p>\r\n','images/upload/dad-son-water.jpg',1,'2014-04-29 00:00:00','2014-04-29 00:00:00','','Water makes up more than two thirds of human body weight, and without water, we would die in a few days.

Whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and blood fibrinogen level are considered to be independent risk factors for coronary heart disease, and they all tend to be elevated by dehydration. Therefore, healthy people who drink adequate levels of plain water generally keep their hydration level up and have a reduced risk of dying from a heart attack in comparison to people who do not drink adequate water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water intake and risk of coronary heart disease</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water HeartThe clearest and most consistent association with fatal coronary heart disease was found with water intake. Among men, univariate analysis showed a dose-response relation (p &lt; 0.001). Compared with those drinking two or fewer glasses of water daily (low), subjects drinking from three to four glasses (medium) and five or more glasses (high) had relative risks of 0.65 (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 0.40, 1.05) and 0.46 (95 percent CI: 0.28, 0.75), respectively. Among women, the relative risks of drinking medium and high levels of water were 0.54 (95 percent CI: 0.32, 0.90) and 0.59 (95 percent CI: 0.36, 0.97), respectively. The associations remained virtually unchanged when adjusting for traditional risk factors as well as for fluids other than water, energy intake, diet, exercise, and when weight replaced body mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why may coronary heart disease risk be increased with a higher intake of fluids other than water? Several mechanisms can be postulated. Caffeinated beverages are mild diuretics and thus may raise blood viscosity. High energy drinks such as juices and regular sodas have osmolalities between 556 and 836 mOsm/kg. Their consumption causes a net movement of fluid from the vascular system into the intestinal lumen, resulting in a rapid elevation in blood viscosity after consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other fluids probably have a similar impact as long as they do not contain excessive levels of sugar, salt or other chemicals that the body excretes in water, thus reducing the body&rsquo;s water content. Although many people could and probably should drink more water than they do, drinking excessive levels of water can flush away essential salts from the body and lead to potential health problems.</p>\r\n','images/upload/water-heart.jpg',1,'2014-04-29 00:00:00','2014-04-29 00:00:00','','Water intake and risk of coronary heart disease','news'),(29,'water and beautiful skin','<p>It&#39;s no wonder that spas across the nation are turning toward filtered water system.

But this undertaking isn&#39;t as simple as tossing in a few pool chemicals and calling it a day. Adding the right amount of chlorine is sometimes a tough balancing act, but it is absolutely necessary to maintaining a healthy pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First off, if a lot of organic materials have built up in the pool, normal doses of chlorine is not going to resolve the problem. You will have to shock the water, which involves adding heavy amounts of chlorine for a short amount of time to fully destroy all bacteria and organic matter in the pool. If it has been a while since the pool has been shocked or it was just filled, shock it first so that the chlorine can do its job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kid SwimmingNext, the pH level of the water needs to be measured. If the pH level is too high, even having the right level of chlorine won&#39;t be enough to make sure the water is safe to swim in. Chlorine loses its effectiveness in acidic water. Shoot for a pH that is the same as human tears--around 7.2 but up to 7.6. If the pH is too high, it is time to add some muriatic acid in the deep end of the pool while the pump is running. This will quickly circulate the compound, and you can retest it in about six hours. Don&#39;t try to lower the level too quickly or the levels will fluctuate, causing you frustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the water is ready, start adding the chlorine. Pool chlorine is sold as tablets or sticks that can be placed into floating or automatic feeders. Try to avoid those that require water running over them to dissolve, as you will be tempted to place it in the skimmer basket. This will introduce very low pH water into your pumping system and cause it to prematurely fail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also avoid tablets that crumble and fall apart. Good quality tablets will dissolve at a more or less even rate, and will simply get smaller over time while keeping their shape. This is especially important if a floating chlorinator is going to be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatic chlorine feeders are very popular with pool owners because of their ease of use and the help they provide in properly maintaining a swimming pool. Chemical feeders will meter out precise amounts into the pool automatically, while allowing the pool owner a means of precise control over the amounts that are dumped into the swimming pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of how frequently or what system you use to add chlorine to the water, the chlorine level should stay between 1.0 and 3.0 parts per million (ppm) to maintain a healthy pool. Any higher and you start to run the risk of red eyes and swimmers itch. There should be at the most a slight smell of chlorine even at the highest levels. If there is a strong smell, that is a sign that you need to shock the pool and remove built up contaminants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calculating how much chlorine to use will involve some math but nothing too complicated. The hardest part is determining the total gallons in the pool. Luckily, many pool supply houses provide online calculators to help, such as the one at http://www.havuz.org/pool-calculators.htm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you know total volume, then it&#39;s a simple formula: one ounce of chlorine will give you a 1 ppm in 75,000 gallons of water, or 0.013 ounces of chlorine per 100 gallons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, what is most important is consistency. Make sure to check the pH levels every two to three days as the pH level will effect how well the chlorine sanitizes the pool. And, keep in mind that the chlorine is neutralized when it interacts with any contaminant and by sunlight. If the proper levels of chlorine are not being maintained with a floating device that uses one-inch tablets, you may need to go with three-inch tablets or adjust the chlorine feeder if you have an automatic system. Stay consistent with testing of the water, and any changes can be quickly caught and corrected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','images/upload/kid-swimming.jpg',1,'2014-04-29 00:00:00','2014-04-29 00:00:00','','Keeping the water clean, pathogen free, and sanitary is key to getting the most enjoyment out of your swimming pool.','news'),(31,'Contact us','<p>PO Box 4553 | Ascot | SL5 5BB</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tel: 08456 805 905</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fax: 08452 991 623</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email: contact@happywater.com</p>\r\n','images/upload/logo5.png',1,'2014-04-29 00:00:00','2014-04-29 00:00:00','','If you have any requests or queries feel free to get in touch with us, we\'re happy to hear from you!','contact'),(32,'Swimming and chlorine: How to protect your  skin, hair, and health','<p>Water is one of the most important things for our bodies. In it&#39;s most natural and purest form that is. With that in mind, one could think that swimming -- immersing oneself in a pool of water-- is a healthy thing. The health benefits of swimming are wonderful. However, the very things put in water to protect us from infection are responsible for some adverse effects on our skin, hair and even teeth. The primary enemy? Chlorine, a gaseous greenish-yellow element used for its disinfecting power. There are ways to combat this, as explained below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baby SwimmingOne of the most common and obvious problems affect blondes. Blonde hair is known to turn green because of the exposure to copper (pipes) and chlorine. Skin problems can also occur in frequent swimmers. If you think about it, skin is the largest organ in the body. While technically water-proof, the skin can absorb contaminants from water. Although long term exposure to chlorine may cause cancer and other ailments, problems to skin and hair are usually not life-threatening. Irritation can occur on the skin and scalp, making for a dry, itchy body and head. Additionally, the Pacific Center for Health says that chlorine can also destroy much-needed proteins in our bodies. Depleted of protein, skin and hair can become very dry. Hair can become unmanageable and color-treated hair can be ruined. Thankfully there are several ways to protect ourselves from chlorine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Hair</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply a thin layer of oil to your hair before swimming. You can pour olive oil, baby oil or coconut oil onto your hands and just rub it through your hair to protect it.<br />\r\nWet your hair with non-chlorinated water prior to swimming will lessen the amount of the element that can be absorbed.<br />\r\nPurchase shampoos such as Ultraswim and other pre-swim conditioning treatments that can keep hair healthy when swimming.<br />\r\nRe-wet your hair frequently to rinse of the chlorine and keep it saturated with clean non-chlorinated water.<br />\r\nUse a bathing cap to keep water from contacting your hair.<br />\r\nAdd a post-swim routine of deep shampooing, not using the high setting on the blow dryer and using a wide-tooth comb instead of a brush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Skin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apply a waterproof sunscreen designed to protect against chlorine sensitivities.<br />\r\nShower frequently between swims to reduce the amount of overall chlorine your skin will absorb.<br />\r\nShower again when you are done swimming to remove all traces of chlorine. You can use soap this time.<br />\r\nApply after-swim lotions that are specifically designed to neutralize chlorine&rsquo;s causticity.<br />\r\nWhile swimming in a chlorinated pool can heighten the chances of these affects, even the light amounts of chlorine in your daily showers can harm your skin and hair. Therefore you should consider installing either a shower filter or whole house filter to remove this and other chemicals from your daily bathing routinue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chlorine isn&#39;t the only pool culprit. Water itself (ironically) removes moisture from the skin. There is a layer of oil present on all of our bodies, but once immersed in water, it disappears. This allows for the dryness to set in. To combat this, after showering (following the swim), apply a moisturizer- either a lotion or cream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let the Healing Begin!<br />\r\nIf you are suffering from skin or hair problems caused by chlorine exposure do not worry because the damage is reversible. The human body is incredibly resilient and if you follow the proper care and diligence to reduce contact with chlorine, your body will quickly heal on its own, and you may find that you can still enjoy fun activities such as swimming!</p>\r\n','images/upload/baby-swimming.jpg',1,'2014-04-29 00:00:00','2014-04-29 00:00:00','','Water is one of the most important things for our bodies.','news'),(33,'Chlorine Alternatives for pool sanitation','<p>Chlorine has been the de facto means of sanitizing and keeping swimming pools clean in the United States for decades despite healthier and better alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no denying that chlorine is a poison, and its ability to kill bacteria is the reason it is so widely used.

Swallowing pool water is the most obvious, but the swimming and splashing of people in the pool also releases chlorine gases into the air where they are breathed in. Chlorine is also absorbed through the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to WebMD.com, swimmers have experienced breathing problems similar to asthma after swimming in public pools even though they showed no sign of any respiratory problems previously.

So, while there is a heavier outlay of money at first, it will eventually pay for itself. Chlorine contributes to the rusting out of pipes, eats up pool liners, and leads to other such damage to pool structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, most ozone pool systems sold in the US, in order to prevent ozone from ending up in the pool and to cut down on the costs for having the extra tanks and such, use very low concentrations of ozone. These are almost useless as the ozone levels are so low that it will take several passes and perhaps days for the water to become fully sanitized. Be prepared to spend some money on a ozone system, and pick up one that works like the European models for best results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultra violet light (UV) is also a viable alternative to a straight chemical approach as it can clean the water effectively while reducing the need for chlorine use. These systems also offer an advantage over ozone systems in that a UV light can be retrofitted over the existing pumping system to bombard the water with the light after going through the filter whereas an ozone system requires a complete installation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UV has been shown to be highly effective in killing bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, and it is used by many smaller scale water purification systems. The drawback to the UV system is that some chlorine is still needed to combat pathogen growth once the water goes back into the pool, but much less is needed. Around 60% less chlorine for a comparable sized pool is required. Such a low concentration will have no smell and any irritation or side effects will be minimal if even existent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several drawbacks and health risks with chlorine. Using one of these chlorine alternatives will make your pool much more enjoyable and healthier for it&#39;s swimmers.

Chlorine is a useful chemical that is used to sanitize tap water and make it safe for drinking. Unfortunately it is also a toxic substance that is extremely irritating on human skin and lungs. When you take a shower, the heat opens up your pores and your skin absorbs chlorine from both the water and the steam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chlorine has an oxidizing effect on human skin because it splits hydrogen from water, causing the release of nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride. These gas compounds have been scientifically proven to cause tissue damage to our bodies at the molecular level. The skin is our body&#39;s largest organ and it is entirely chlorine absorbent. Chlorine will chemically bond with the protein in our skin and hair, making hair brittle and dry, and causing skin to itch, dry, and age prematurely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 50% of our daily chlorine exposure comes from showering. This is because chlorine is not only absorbed through our skin, but it is also vaporized in the shower and is inhaled into our lungs, and transferred directly into the blood stream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential health problems associated with daily, long-term chlorine exposure include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dry Skin &amp; Hair<br />\r\nHives and Rashes<br />\r\nAsthma &amp; Breathing Problems<br />\r\nPremature Wrinkling of Skin<br />\r\nCancer from THM Agents<br />\r\nThere are several water filtration systems that will remove chlorine from your bath water.

And you would not be all together wrong. Chlorinated lime is a chemical that was first made by passing chlorine gas over slaked lime [Ca(OH2)] to form a chemical with the formula CaOCl2. It is used for bleaching and is commonly referred to as bleaching powder. Although the chemical is sometimes referred to as chloride of lime, this is not accurate because the chemical is actually a crystalline mixture of calcium hypochlorite [Ca(OCl)2] with alkaline calcium chloride [Ca(Cl)2:Ca(OH)2:H2O]. The mixture contains 30-35% active chlorine. Chlorinated lime is sometimes confused with calcium hydrochloride that is marketed under the trade name of HTH (high-test hypochlorite).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So more specifically, just what is chlorinated lime used for? Chlorinated lime is a very strong oxidizing agent that is active in alkaline and neutral solutions. It has many uses and plays a role in public health and environmental hygiene. It is used to disinfect drinking water, pool water and wastewater; to sanitize equipment and soil contaminated areas; as a whitening and bleaching agent in the textiles, leather, pulp and paper industries; and more recently as a strong oxidizing agent to neutralize certain hazardous products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the hazards associated with chlorinated lime? Chlorinated lime is a stable substance and is considered safer to handle than liquid chlorine and it has a much lower risk for atmospheric pollution than chlorine. The chemical however, will react with acid, even weak carbonic acid from the air to liberate chlorine. Being a strong oxidizing agent, it reacts violently with highly reduced compounds like oil and grease. Because the chemical is hygroscopic and dissolves readily in water, the dry powder can burn skin and should be stored where moisture cannot get to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most applications chlorinated lime is used in the form of a solution with strictly defined concentrations characteristic for each application. It should not be used in powder form in un-vented areas where the release of chlorine gas could be a hazard. A safer product to use strictly for generating high pH solutions as a method of disinfection is hydrated or slaked lime, not chlorinated lime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n','images/upload/baby-water.jpg',1,'2014-04-29 00:00:00','2014-04-29 00:00:00','','You may think of chlorinated lime as just basically your ordinary lime sometimes used for stabilization and PH control for drinking water systems across the US.

The water in our saliva helps facilitate chewing and swallowing, ensuring that food will slide easily down the esophagus. Water also lubricates our joints and cartilages and allows them to (pardon the pun) move more fluidly. When dehydrated, the body rations water away from the joints. Less lubrication equals greater friction and that can cause joint, knee and back pain potentially leading to injuries and arthritis. Even our eyeballs need plenty of lubrication to work well and remain healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWater regulates body temperature<br />\r\nOur bodies can control over-heating through perspiration from sweat glands in the skin and from evaporation which produces a cooling effect. Blood is also routed into areas close to the surface of the skin where it can be cooled and then carried back to the interior of the body. Conversing in a cold environment, the skin maintains proper body temperature by shunting the blood away from the exterior surface thereby conserving heat within the body. The movement of water within our cellular systems also transports vital blood plasma which is 92% made of water. Blood plasma play a critical role in buffering the body&rsquo;s pH, circulating antibodies from the immune system, and regulating osmotic balance which all helps to maintain proper body temperature.</p>\r\n','images/upload/water1.jpg',1,'2014-04-29 00:00:00','2014-04-29 00:00:00','','Water makes up more than two thirds of human body weight, and without water, we would die in a few days.

And as we become more active, so do we.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More vigorous activity in this weather generally means we sweat more. How can you replace the body fluids you&#39;re losing? And do you really need to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s answer the second question first. &quot;Yes!&quot; nutrition experts say emphatically. &quot;Most people are walking around in a moderately dehydrated state,&quot; says Susan Kleiner, PhD, RD, author of Power Eating. According to Kleiner, we all need a &quot;bare minimum&quot; of 8 to 12 cups of fluids daily, even more to replace the fluid you lose during exercise. Of these 8 to 12 cups, Kleiner advises at least 5 cups be pure water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sweating It Away</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kleiner explains that you lose about 4 cups of water per hour of exercise, depending on how much you weigh and how much -- and how quickly -- you perspire. A moderate workout in a mild climate will likely result in a loss of 1 to 2 quarts of fluid per hour through perspiration. The more intense the exercise or the more extreme the temperatures, the greater the fluid loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;If you don&#39;t replenish your fluid losses during exercise, you will fatigue early, and your performance will be diminished,&quot; says Kleiner. &quot;If you don&#39;t replenish fluid after exercise, your performance on successive days will decay, and your long-term health may be at risk.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAccording to the National Athletic Trainers&#39; Association, says Kleiner, dehydration can impair your physical performance after less than an hour of exercise -- even sooner if you start working out in a dehydrated state. It can also increase your risk of developing symptoms of heat illness, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not Just for Athletes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s not just athletes -- even the weekend variety -- who are dehydrated, says Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, author of From Fatigued to Fantastic!: A Manual for Moving Beyond Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia. For even the sedentary he suggests: &quot;Simply occasionally pay attention to your mouth and lips. If they are dry, you&#39;re thirsty and need more water.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dehydration can be a serious problem for anyone, but children and older adults are at greater risk, according to the Gatorade Sports Science Institute. It offers these tips to avoid dehydration:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When exercising, drink early and often. Research shows exercise under warm or hot and humid conditions can cause dehydration in as little as 30 minutes. So it&#39;s important to consume fluids not only during and after exercise, but also before a workout or strenuous activity.<br />\r\nDon&#39;t wait until you&#39;re dehydrated to start drinking. Drinking in a dehydrated state can cause gastrointestinal distress.<br />\r\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends that athletes drink enough fluid to fully replace sweat losses during their activity. At a minimum, drink 8 to 10 ounces of fluid every 15 minutes during exercise.<br />\r\nWhen active, don&#39;t rely on your sense of thirst. When you are hot and sweaty, your thirst mechanism can shut off quickly and you may not realize you need fluids. Drink on a schedule.<br />\r\nCheck the color of your urine. If your urine looks like the color of apple juice, you are probably dehydrated. If it looks more like the color of lemonade, you are probably well hydrated.</p>\r\n','images/upload/abc.jpg',1,'2014-04-16 00:00:00','2014-04-24 00:00:00','','Yes, water is everywhere these days, but are you drinking enough of it?','news'),(43,'Drinking water with meals can impair digestion','<p>It&#39;s true that the entire digestive system works more efficiently when it&#39;s well-hydrated, but this doesn&#39;t mean it should be flooded with cold water right when it&#39;s working to digest your last meal. Too much water during meals can interfere with natural levels of acid and bile needed in the stomach to properly digest your food. In particular, too much&nbsp;<em>cold</em>&nbsp;water during meals can slow digestion and may cause cramping in sensitive individuals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Tips for Drinking Water with Meals</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe general rule of thumb is to avoid drinking water from about 15 minutes before you eat until at least one hour after you eat. But it&#39;s all too common for people to go to extremes with this advice. Avoiding any and all liquids before, during and after meals is rarely needed to see improvements in digestion. Instead, apply these simple tips for drinking at mealtime:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>1. Think small sips.</strong>&nbsp;You don&#39;t have to forego water during meals altogether. Instead, simply opt to take small sips of water during your meal. This is great for cleansing the palate and maintaining hydration without flooding your digestive system with massive amounts of water just when it&#39;s getting down to business. You can also add a squeeze of lemon or a bit of apple cider vinegar to your&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/water.html\">water</a>&nbsp;to help aid the digestive process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>2. Choose warm over cold.</strong>&nbsp;Iced drinks may be particularly problematic during meals, especially for those with existing digestive issues. If you&#39;d like to have something to sip on during meals, warm liquids are more friendly for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/digestion.html\">digestion</a>. Warm tea or homemade broth are excellent to accompany your meal, and can actually aid digestion rather than impair it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>3. Hydrate before you eat.</strong>&nbsp;If you frequently find yourself thirsty during and after your&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/meals.html\">meals</a>, it may help to make a habit of drinking a glass or two of pure water about 15 to 30 minutes before you eat. This can prevent the urge to drink too much water while your stomach is working to digest your meal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>4. Stay hydrated during the rest of the day.</strong>&nbsp;Drinking during meals can be a difficult habit to break. However, it&#39;s easier to do if you keep yourself hydrated the rest of the time. Begin your day by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/drinking.html\">drinking</a>&nbsp;a glass or two of pure water and then make a habit of repeating this between meals. Soon you&#39;ll be well-hydrated and won&#39;t crave large amounts of water during your meals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>5. Think moderation.</strong>&nbsp;There is no reason to become dogmatic about drinking during meals. Some people find it makes an enormous difference to avoid drinking a lot of liquid during a meal, while others find it has little effect. Others note that simply avoiding ice water or not drinking quite so much water during meals is enough to ease their digestive woes. It will depend on the individual how much of an impact this has on his/her digestion, but it&#39;s worth considering if you have problems with gas, bloating or pain after meals.</p>\r\n','images/upload/persondrinkingwater-2.jpg',1,'2014-04-21 00:00:00','2014-04-28 00:00:00','','(NaturalNews) Most of us have heard it a hundred times: drink eight glasses of water a day to stay healthy and hydrated.
